        This uses the
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/aws-ip-ranges.html" target="_blank">AWS IP Ranges JSON file</a>
        to determine if a given IP address is used by AWS and if so what service(s) and region(s) it is
        allocated to. This information is not particularly precise (a lot of services are listed as EC2).
        The specific services that can be shown are listed in the AWS documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a hostname is entered, rather than directly looking the value up in the JSON file, the
        <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/make-api-requests/dns-json/" target="_blank">Cloudflare DNS over HTTPS API</a>
        is used to get the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for the given domain. Only <code>A</code> and
        <code>AAAA</code> records will be checked.
      </p>
      <p>
        This also won't work if an organization is using
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html" target="_blank">Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) addresses</a>
        for their services. Those addresses won't appear in the <code>ip-ranges.json</code> file so they can't be
        included here.

        <strong>Note</strong>: This tool should not be used for making security decisions. While
        DNS data is fetched directly from CloudFlare using DNS over HTTPS, the responses are
        not validated with DNSSEC. Additionally, the <code>ip-ranges.json</code> data may be
        cached; you should always
        <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/aws-ip-ranges.html#aws-ip-download" target="_blank">download</a>
        the latest version of the file directly from AWS after validating the TLS certificates
        presented during the download are correct.
